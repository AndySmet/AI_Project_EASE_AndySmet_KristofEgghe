Embarrassingly Shallow Autoencoders using the comics subset of the Goodreads dataset


EASE_AndySmet_Kristof_Egghe.ipynb is the notebook containing the implementation from the EASER paper.


For our optimizations:
- First run preprocessing.ipynb to preprocess the data and create the 5 random folds
- Run GroupPreparation.ipynb


- Run Hyperparameters.ipynb if you want to run hyperparameter optimization on each split

- Run Evaluation if you just want to run on the 5 random splits and get the recall, ndcg and qualitative results

- Run session_based_evaluation.ipynb to run on the session based split dataset  and get the recall, ndcg and qualitative results
